    <h1>Hobby</h1>
    <img src="../images/gaming.webp" alt="gaming">
    <p>Playing computer games is my hobby. It allows me to immerse myself in different worlds, experience new adventures
        and test my skills. I enjoy the thrill of beating challenging levels and the satisfaction of overcoming
        obstacles. Not only do computer games provide entertainment, but they also help me improve my problem-solving
        and critical thinking skills. </p>
